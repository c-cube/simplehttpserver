(** Serving static content from directories

    This module provides the same functionality as the "http_of_dir" tool.
    It exposes a directory (and its subdirectories), with the optional ability
    to delete or upload files.

(** behavior of static directory.

    This controls what happens when the user requests the path to
    a directory rather than a file. *)

  | Lists
  (** Lists content of directory. Be careful of security implications. *)
  | Index_or_lists
  (** Redirect to index.html if present and lists content otherwise.
      This is useful for tilde ("~") directories and other per-user behavior,
      but be mindful of security implications *)
  | Forbidden
  (** Forbid access to directory. This is suited for serving assets, for example. *)

(** configuration for static file handlers *)

  (** Behavior when serving a directory and not a file *)

      uploaded files. *)
